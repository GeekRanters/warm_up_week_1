## Question One
You stand at a fork in the road. Next to each of the two forks, there stands a guard. You know the following things: First that one path leads to paradise, the other leads to Death. You cannot distinguish between the two paths. You also know that one of the two guards always tells the truth and the other always lies. You have permission to ask one guard one question to discover which path leads to paradise. What one question would you ask to guarantee you take the path to paradise?

The question is: _"What road would the other guard tell me to take?"_

> If you ask the one who tells the truth, he'll tell you the other guard would send you to Death.
> So take the other road!
